One key question: am I better off figuring out brightness of all points up front, or doing it tadpole by tadpole?
All points:
  Say it's 1000 x 800. That's 800,000
Tadpoles (assumptions: they look 5 pixels away and there are 20,000 tadpoles)
  Num pixels is (5*2+1) * (5*2+1) - 1 = 120.
  120 * 20,000 = 2,400,000

But the numbers change a lot based on width/height and number of tadpoles.
